It is very hard to find good materials for learning how to trade, learning how to have the kind of intuitions and heuristics about a market that a trader ought to develop, in any context outside of a firm."

Using a play currency, we went through various hands-on exercises to solidify concepts taught in energetically-delivered lectures."

              "To summarize, here are the key lessons I learned:
              - Beware Adverse Selection: Have a story for why your trade makes sense in a competitive environment.
              - Stay Vigilant: Inattentive trading is dangerous, not trading is always safe.
              - Focus Quickly: Learn to make snap judgements of where further effort will be most valuable.
              - Spot Arbitrage: Inconsistencies between prices mean free money if you find them.
              - Start Simple: A working strategy beats a perfect plan that's not ready."
